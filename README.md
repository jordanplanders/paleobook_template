# Exploring the Scale Enigma in Climate Variability

This repository contains the notebooks used to generate figures and conduct analysis from the paper *Regime Shifts in Holocene Paleohydrology as Recorded by Asian Speleothems*.

## Structure

This repository is loosely structured in a way that is similar to the publication it is based on. It contains a few sections: 

1. Loading Data
2. Exploring the Data
3. Main Analysis

Each of these contains notebooks that reproduce figures from the main text of the original publication, [ James, A., Hu, J., Emile-Geay, J., Partin, J. W., Scroxton, N., Malik, N., & Gao, Y. (2025). Regime shifts in Holocene paleohydrology as recorded by Asian speleothems.
